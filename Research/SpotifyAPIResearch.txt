Title or name of research/training: 
    Spotify API Research

Why you are doing it: 
    Need to understand what metrics are applied to individual songs and how we can use those metrics.

What you expect to learn/do.
    From the research gathered, I plan to implement the user options within the U/I and also informing my teamates
    on what direction we will be going with the playlist customization. 

What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  Be specific.  For example, "Writing the UI" is not sufficient.   "Writing the Login class" is.
    From the metrics given, we aim to integrate them through user preferences. This will allow us to generate 
    the custom playlist. 

What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training.: 
    "Define 'buckets' for playlist sorting" Using the metrics we are able to gather, we will define types of playlist users can generate from their music.
    Furthemore, in the next sprint this information will be used for algorithm design.

Metrics: 

Audio features for one track:

acousticness    number [float]
    A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
    Range: 0 - 1
    Example: 0.00242
    analysis_url
    string


A URL to access the full audio analysis of this track. An access token is required to access this data.
Example: "https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/2takcwOaAZWiXQijPHIx7B"


danceability    number [float]
    Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
    Example: 0.585


duration_ms integer
    The duration of the track in milliseconds.
    Example: 237040


energy  number [float]
    Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
    Example: 0.842
    
    
id    string
    The Spotify ID for the track.
    Example: "2takcwOaAZWiXQijPHIx7B"


instrumentalness    number [float]
    Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.
    Example: 0.00686


key     integer
    he key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.
    Range: -1 - 11
    Example: 9


liveness    number [float]
    Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
    Example: 0.0866


loudness    number [float]
    The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.
    Example: -5.883


mode    integer
    Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
    Example: 0


speechiness     number [float]
    Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
    Example: 0.0556


tempo   number [float]
    The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
    Example: 118.211


time_signature  integer
    An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of "3/4", to "7/4".
    Range: 3 - 7
    Example: 4


track_href  string
    A link to the Web API endpoint providing full details of the track.
    Example: "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2takcwOaAZWiXQijPHIx7B"


type    string
    The object type.
    Allowed values: "audio_features"


uri     string
    The Spotify URI for the track.
    Example: "spotify:track:2takcwOaAZWiXQijPHIx7B"


valence     number [float]
    A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
    Range: 0 - 1
    Example: 0.428
